# Generate-an-SVG-Logo

## Description

Using Node.js, this application takes the user input and generates a logo that saves into a SVG file. The logo that is created is based off of criteria the user picks. 

## Installation

This application requires Node.js v16 or v18. Inquirer v8.2.4 is needed and is installed using npm i inquirer@8.2.4. Jest is also needed and can be installed using npm i jest. To restrict the user inputs to a max length, I installed npm i inquirer-maxlength-input-prompt.
